            <p class="card-text">As a user researcher, I was interested in learning more about the elements that impact users' decision-making while choosing a holiday place and length. And identified goals to gain more insights like process, tools used, budget, time, and length of the trip. I prepared a set of questions to conduct interviews with 5 people from various backgrounds in order to determine their preferences and pain points. When I questioned them, I discovered that each one had a unique viewpoint with a few common pain points.</p>

The issue is that many apps lack personalization, resulting in stressful preparation for users. Solutions - young adult travelers plan their trips stay organized, and provide personalized possibilities. Constraints were collecting all preferences as well as meeting the budget.</p>

        <p class="card-text">The art of storytelling - establishing a user scenario, creating a narrative storyboard, and creating a user journey map. I developed a user scenario where my user Megan Jones, who is a busy working professional, wishes to take a vacation with her friends and family. They use a number of websites when planning, researching, and interacting. It's a hectic and exhausting session. I made a storyboard to imagine how a user might engage with my app. They install Pack My Bags. With this new app, they are able to plan, collaborate, evaluate and finalize a trip. ​To gain more insight, I created a user journey map, which assisted me in identifying significant interactions with the app and discussing the user's feelings, motivations, and queries at each stage.</p>

I developed a clickable digital prototype to generate interactive flows that explore how a user might interact with the app. ​I developed a clickable digital prototype to generate interactive flows that explore how a user might interact with the app. I spent some more time creating a color version of the IOS prototype while keeping usability heuristics in my mind.</p>

Having a progress bar would have made it simpler for the user to determine how long the procedure would take.

        <h2 class="card-title">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p class="card-text"></p>I observed that I spent a lot of time working on the wireframes and ended up making them far too detailed before testing the clickable prototype. I realized that more effort need to be spent on user flow in the initial stages before designing detailed wireframes. The key mantra is to iterate, iterate, iterate. Constant iteration with the app experience would fully match our users' needs. It taught me that no design is flawless and there is always an opportunity for improvement in order to adapt and produce better user experiences. In my view, Design thinking is a very critical element to produce an application with a superior user experience, sufficient effort should be spent in the early phases of the application development.</p>
